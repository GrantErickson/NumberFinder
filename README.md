# NumberFinder
A general solution to number puzzles where certain numbers combine and add to other numbers with constraints like certain numbers having to be even or odd or unique.

These are for puzzles like (this is totally made up as an example and is likely wrong)
1. Digits A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all unique
2. A+B=c
3. A+D=F+G
4. C+G=20
5. F+E is odd
6. B+C is even

Goals: 
1. Allow this to be entered in some type of easy format into the tool.
2. Allow for adding additional constraint types easily.
2. Try not to use a brute force approach.
